He may be getting at the broader point of whether individual ships should be protected. The view that the world has taken is that Prosperity Guardian provides an umbrella to shipping more widely. The sheer volume of ordinary traffic through the Red sea means that we need that US-led international taskforce for the security of the Red sea and the gulf of Aden."

Last week, I was onboard HMS Diamond\u2014which is right at the heart of the issue in the Red sea\u2014talking to our brave sailors who are out there protecting our critical sea lanes. The House will know that this is the first Royal Navy ship\u2019s company for 32 years who have fired in anger\u2014or in self-defence, in their case. It was fascinating to talk to them about their experience and to witness their professionalism in dealing with this challenge."

At the start of the year, the world sent a very clear message to the Houthis: \u201cEnd your illegal and unjustified actions. Stop risking innocent lives. Please stop illegally detaining vessels and crews. Cease threatening the global economy.\u201d All those warnings fell on deaf ears, and eventually enough was enough."
