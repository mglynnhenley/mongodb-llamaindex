What discussions has she had with her Chinese counterpart to stop those unprovoked attacks and allow those peaceful fishermen simply to go about earning a livelihood to support their families?"

In many respects, it underpins  what we mean by a free society. Of course, we all know that; it is something that we repeat, automaton-like, in a way that risks giving rise to complacency. However, as I watch the actions of authoritarian states in these times of turbulence; as I see western democracies in a knot of angst over our values; and as I see our populations question, from the safety of these shores, whether our values still matter, I am reminded of the need to make that case again and again."

Secondly, will the Government commit to a national security investigation of these purchases? Thirdly, do the Government not recognise that their intervention in the United Arab Emirates\u2019 purchase of Vodafone sets a precedent allowing them to intervene in this case? Finally, will they look either to extend the  Defending Democracy Taskforce or those 17 sectors, to ensure that we can protect our media?

We need some certainty about how and where such an intervention can be made, and not purely on competition grounds."

Conditions such as autism have markers from six months old, as it becomes obvious through the way children learn, move or pay attention. Existing weaknesses in the SEND system, which were magnified by the pandemic, also make it difficult for people with autism to get a diagnosis. There are inconsistencies in how SEND is identified, a lack of joined-up thinking on care, and a lack of clarity regarding accountability and responsibility in organisations. That leads to delays in an already weak system, making the fight that many parents undertake to have their child assessed even harder."

It was an unnecessary distraction that took Hayley away from being the mum she needed to be for both her children, which made everyday family life harder.

The reason for this new clause is that things have moved on since the Communications Act 2003.

However, there is a need now to be more explicit about the issues that people face in the interpretation of media. For that reason, it is time for a duty to be placed upon public service broadcasters to develop media literacy strategies, which will enable the receivers of their broadcasts to better understand and better cut through some of the misinformation that is being purveyed."

We have already seen the danger of artificially generated news stories and images, with reports of inaccurate data being used to inform artificial intelligence-generated stories, false attributions to journalists and creators, and people discovering that their likenesses have been used without their knowledge or consent. That is why the NUJ is trying to encourage the debate about who is responsible for raising the levels media literacy. New clause 23 would simply put a statutory duty upon public service broadcasters to develop and publish a strategy for what they are doing to raise media literacy, and give Ofcom a role in monitoring that."

We saw the same with regards to the BBC\u2019s news channel and BBC World Service cutbacks. We found that there were groups who were not consulted or engaged whatsoever. As a result, we believe that poor decisions were made. It is within the BBC\u2019s governance framework and the royal charter to highlight public service broadcasters\u2019 obligation to regularly consult the general public and key demographics of viewers and listeners when making key decisions about programming and services to local communities.

My right hon. Friend spoke about the discussions he had, but he would agree that the stick and the carrot at that time were thought to be necessary to persuade red-top publishers such as The Daily Mail and The Sun to join a regulator recognised by the PRP. What I do not think he anticipated\u2014indeed, nobody anticipated it at the time\u2014was that not a single major publisher would agree to co-operate with the regime that was being put in place. That includes The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer and the Financial Times. Not one major publisher said that it would co-operate with the system that was put in place, so it has plainly failed. For that reason alone the Government should revisit the issue, remove section 40, and instead encourage those who do not currently accept the ruling of an independent regulator to join the one in existence, which is IPSO. I know that my right hon. Friend and I will not agree on this point, but his suggestion that it was somehow an oversight to include a commitment to repeal in the manifestos of 2017 and 2019 is simply not correct. He will be aware that there is unanimity among all the major publishers that section 40 represents an attack on media freedom. It is not just the publishers who hold that view; many campaigning organisations, such as Reporters Without Borders, have actually downgraded the UK\u2019s press freedom rating because of the existence of section 40, and it is certainly viewed as an infringement of media freedom."

The Bill gives public service content an \u201cappropriate\u201d level of prominence on online services, which should make it easier to find not only the apps that take us to the BBC or ITV on a smart TV, but to find those channels on the traditional TV guide with which we are all familiar. However, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee made the suggestion, which I have tabled in the form of an amendment, that the word \u201cappropriate\u201d is perhaps unhelpfully subjective, and should be replaced with \u201csignificant\u201d.

I have concerns about that change to Channel 4\u2019s model, which has worked extremely well for a long time, although the previous Secretary of State was not so keen on its existence\u2014or, at least, its future. Channel 4 has historically supported the independent production sector throughout the UK, in places such as my constituency in the far north of Scotland, but there are concerns that allowing it to create its own content could destabilise the sector. Given the Government\u2019s track record on Channel 4, my ultimate fear is that this could be used as a stick with which to beat the channel, although I hope that does not happen. That being said, Channel 4 and the independent production sector are integral to each other, which is why I am glad to see the channel\u2019s qualifying independent commitment to the sector increased to 40%, and to hear that any changes are likely to be very gradual, allowing the market to adjust accordingly. That can only be a good thing."

We in this country benefit from a vibrant and rich media, as was pointed out in an urgent question earlier today, but whereas our broadcasting media are the envy of the world, our print media languish at the bottom of international league tables when it comes to public trust and confidence. However, the Government now seek to repeal section 40, although they have no plans to replace it with any alternative mechanism of independent and impartial regulation. That not only leaves local and independent newspapers unable to defend themselves against expensive litigation in the form of strategic lawsuits against public participation, but makes it harder for a normal person to take legal action against a large publisher.

The Bill as drafted fails to recognise that importance by neglecting to try to understand how the viewing habits of children and young people are changing. Provision for children by public service broadcasters is under threat because so few children now watch live TV. The top-rated programme on CBBC attracts as few as 50,000 viewers. Children carry entertainment in their pockets, and they can and do switch between various apps and platforms in a matter of seconds, which is understandably affecting investment in children\u2019s programming."

Some 10 million adults listen to podcasts every week.

However, despite apparent cross-party support for the service, Gaelic language broadcasting is still not recognised in legislation across the board in the same way as other minority language services are. That is not to say that Gaelic language broadcasting can be directly compared to Welsh broadcasting, for example, but it is an acknowledgment of the importance of language to our cultural life.

The issue of smaller studios, which is covered in our amendments 82 to 85, was raised with me by the Media Reform Coalition. Having quotas for independent studios is good, but some broadcasters have a predilection to using only the super-indies, which account for about 20% of the companies that make independent productions; the smaller indies account for about 80%. Some broadcasters commission almost everything from that 20% of the market, from companies such as Endemol. Those companies do a great job, but they cannot be considered to be small independent  studios. Amendments 82 to 85 would encourage public service broadcasters to move outside the scope of those largest independent studios and to give some of their work to smaller studios, which would have significant regional benefits."

Ministers have urged us to await those findings, but 2034 is not far away and if these services are to remain, it is crucial that we attract investment and ensure that  they remain commercially viable. To do that, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen North correctly said, they need certainty from the Government. The danger is that without that longer-term certainty, beyond 2034, where the Minister has accepted there is a live question, broadcasters might run down their services and the technology might not be updated. If they get certainty from the Government, they can put in investment to ensure people are not without these crucial services and are not left isolated. If the commercial viability of the service is lost while millions of people are still relying on it, there is a real risk that, perversely, the Government would have to step in and use taxpayers\u2019 money to keep the service going. My constructive proposal would not only help keep people connected but, in the long run, perhaps save taxpayers\u2019 money. Surely it is better to provide the longer-term guarantee now that would enable that investment and deliver a good-quality, universal service for years to come."

That new independent body would have responsibility for and oversight of broadcasting and media matters in Wales, seeking to reflect the needs of Welsh audiences. Under my new clause, a shadow authority would fulfil the functions of that body before its establishment 12 months after the passing of this Act. The report by the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales recommended that move. Some Members will know that the commission was set up by the Welsh Government and is under the chairmanship of the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. It reported last week, and one of its conclusions was that there is a need to look at the devolution of broadcasting. An independent authority to regulate would be an  integral part of that provision. Recent events have shown that there is a real need for such an authority in Wales. Some Members will know about the internal issues at S4C, the Welsh language channel, which make the argument that the current broadcasting framework is unsustainable."

Friend just mentioned for what those ratings should be. The Bill is right to recognise that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. Research has shown that audiences have different expectations of   video on demand services than they do of those operated by public service broadcasters. But where age ratings are in use, is it not common sense to expect a consistent standard? My hon. Friend the Member for South West Devon talked about Disney+ and the fact that the film \u201cAvatar\u201d has a 16-plus rating, even though most parents would think it suitable for much younger children, whereas a series that has scenes of sexual coercion is apparently suitable for nine-plus. The outcome is that parents just turn off the security settings, because they do not trust the ratings. How are parents supposed to understand and apply them if they are not consistent across different platforms and providers?"

The new clause does not seek to mandate the BBFC system, although research has found that 90% of UK parents want on-demand age ratings to be consistent with those for cinema and DVD. Rather, it would set a minimum standard across platforms that parents can trust. We have proof already that that works. Netflix and Prime Video have both voluntarily set up innovative partnerships to include BBFC ratings in their content. That kind of collaboration is in the interests of everyone\u2014parents, children and the platforms themselves. It shows that this can be done without high costs or a reduction in consistency. But the reluctance of Disney+ and others to follow suit shows why this kind of regulation is needed."

It would surely be preferable for all platforms to follow the example of Netflix and Amazon, but we do not need to be overly prescriptive in imposing solutions. Instead, I ask the Government to accept that it is the role of Parliament\u2014not Ofcom\u2014to set minimum standards to ensure the protection of children from harm. New clause 6 would achieve that by requiring tier 1 platforms to apply either the age rating classification system used by the BBFC or a system based on a transparent set of appropriate standards applied consistently. If this House really wants to protect children and wishes to see a trusted, effective regulatory landscape, it is hard to envisage what objections there might be to this provision."

In this Bill, as in the Online Safety Act, Parliament is setting out only the very basic principles through legislation, leaving it up to Ofcom to draft and consult upon the vast majority of the detail."

We cannot leave something so important up to the consultations of an unelected body, especially when the vested interests at play are so  substantial. As other hon. Members have mentioned, once we pass the Bill, Parliament will not get another chance to set the parameters of the video on demand code, so we must ensure that the final text of the Bill sets out what Parliament believes to be the appropriate standards of audience protection."

Just trying hard to prevent children from accessing pornography does not make a platform compliant under that Act. Compliance means actually stopping under-18s from coming across porn. In other words, this Bill requires effective outcome measures and must not give prizes to the tech companies just for taking part."

Instead, the consultation outlines the kind of activities that Ofcom would like to see, rather than the outcomes that it demands. Given that Parliament has tasked Ofcom with adjudicating on what meets the \u201chighly effective\u201d standard, failing to set a clear definition is completely unacceptable. If Ofcom fails to meet the highly effective outcome standards that are clearly laid out in the 2023 Act, it will leave itself open to judicial review from those who take the view that the will of Parliament is serious and who wish to see age verification applied in a way that makes children safe."

What is needed is a change to the system that would change those goals for the better for our fans. The system is currently short-changing fans in Scotland, while elsewhere on these isles, it is a very different story. Football fans in England enjoy free-to-air coverage of their national team via the current deal with Channel 4 and the forthcoming deal with ITV. Viewers in Wales enjoy free-to-air coverage of their national team thanks to S4C\u2019s sub-licensed Welsh language coverage, and viewers in Northern Ireland get free coverage of the Republic of Ireland via RT\u00c9 broadcasts\u2014while many in Northern Ireland welcome that, I appreciate that, for others, it is akin to having England games broadcast in Scotland on Channel 4 and STV.

That is made harder still by the fact that UEFA has bundled Scottish international football rights with those of Wales and Northern Ireland to try and draw larger bids and more money for itself and the national associations. Although the same rights inflation has impacted the BBC, it does not have the same commercial considerations as an STV or an ITV. I appreciate, however, that Tory culture wars have inflicted severe damage to the funding levels available to the BBC in recent years. However, the BBC is required to serve all audiences across the whole of the UK, including provision for those in the nations and regions. From a sporting point of view, that simply does not happen."

Despite the figures not being available, it does not take a genius to ascertain that per-capita spending to secure English sports rights vastly dwarfs that which is spent on Scottish sports rights. Incidentally, I do not blame BBC Scotland for that; the blame lies firmly at BBC network\u2019s door. It  would seem that the approach by the network is to let Scottish football fans eat English cake. If BBC Scotland were afforded the per-capita sums used to secure England football rights, Scotland would be in a far better position to bid for, and secure, Scotland international rights. Or, indeed, if BBC Alba\u2019s funding was anywhere near the levels of per-capita support offered to S4C, that would very likely allow BBC Alba to secure secondary sub-licensed free-to-air Gaelic coverage."

MG Alba, which the Gaelic Media Service now operates as, did not exist. Television was entirely analogue, and Gaelic and Welsh language broadcasting were restricted to Scotland and Wales only."

BBC Alba has developed a reputation for high-quality sports coverage since its inception. It therefore has a strategic interest in where sporting rights go, simply because it has invested a great deal of time and money into securing some of those rights and broadcasting the sports free to air not just in Scotland, but across these isles."

It is not just about time-shifting; that can also  happen just because that is how people absorb content these days. For instance, for the 2022 Commonwealth games in Birmingham, the TV reach was about 20% lower than for the 2014 games in Glasgow, but there were about six times more on-demand views of digital clips. The problem is that without enhanced regulatory protection, what should be shared national moments risk being lost to many people behind a paywall. This Bill is a genuine opportunity to safeguard the future of listed events, as they are now viewed, for future generations."

Many people have been predicting radio\u2019s demise for some time, but the sector is doing strongly. I hope that will continue, and anything that encourages that in the Bill is extremely welcome. Some of the amendments remove an out-of-date requirement on Ofcom to impose fines on national analogue stations such as talkSPORT if they sought to terminate the broadcasting of analogue transmissions before the end of their licence period. I do not think there are any plans for that to happen, but it seems sensible to make such flexibility available, not least because analogue transmission and listening is becoming increasingly rare. Some 76% of listening to commercial radio is now on digital platforms, and looking ahead to the future seems perfectly sensible."

The world has moved on and the press has moved on. We had a discussion about whether regulation or the application of the law is the appropriate way to do this, and I submit that the reason why press behaviour has changed is simply the effective application of the law, and the fact that many newspaper groups have had to pay huge amounts of money because they broke the law in behaving the way they did 10, 15 and 20 years ago. That led to the change in behaviour. Where my right hon. Friend and I would come closer together is on SLAPP cases, and the need for legislation to allow individuals not to be intimidated by rich publishing companies. I know the Government have committed to introducing legislation to see those sorts of cases dismissed at the earliest possible stage, and I urge my colleagues on the Front Bench to do that as soon as possible."

I absolutely get the intention behind them, which is to protect children from unsuitable content, but I am instinctively wary of suggestions that would mean one regulator having to consult another before introducing a code of conduct. Ofcom has considerable powers, and it can operate those powers. I do not think it sensible to try to tie this down to any particular age classification system, not least because some public service broadcasters, who are pretty responsible in not trying to expose content that is unsuitable for children, operate systems of protection that do not rely on age classification. ITV has its guidance system, and many broadcasters operate a system involving a PIN that sensible parents will keep from their children so that they can be protected at home."

A good arrangement would be for broadcasters and other platforms to register with an organisation like the BBFC and have to pay a registration fee, and for the regulator to regulate that rather than the other way round. My right hon. Friend talks about responsible parents, but we need to guide the people who do not know what to look for, who are not media-savvy, and who need some guidance. Even our public service broadcasters do not always get it right, and sometimes there is content that really should not be seen by those aged 15 and under."

I welcome the general support for the Bill given by my hon. Friends the Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates) and for South West Devon (Sir Gary Streeter). Ofcom will be getting new powers under the Bill to look at broader protection measures and to mandate specific approaches in the code, if deemed necessary, which could be BBFC age ratings. We are trying to move to a more outcomes-based approach rather than a prescriptive approach. We think that there has been great innovation in the space of parental controls, which have often been more effective than a badge rating. However, I have heard what has been said in the House today and we will continue to listen on this subject."

We believe that the Bill will bring significant benefits to the Scottish broadcasting sector and creative economy. I do not underestimate the vital role that our public service broadcasters play in supporting that Scottish screen sector. The Bill contains provisions to encourage our PSBs to broadcast programmes in indigenous, regional and minority languages, such as Gaelic, by including them in our new PSB remit for television. I know that this is extremely important to numerous Scottish Members in this House, and I hope the Government\u2019s efforts here are recognised. The partnership between MG Alba and the BBC is particularly significant for Gaelic language broadcasting. I can assure Members that the ongoing provision of Gaelic will be a key consideration as the Secretary of State and I progress the BBC funding review and the forthcoming BBC charter review. Of course, Scottish audiences will also continue to benefit from the prominence provisions in the Bill."

It is another issue where we are trying to  find a course through. Sports rights holders use income from the sale of rights to the benefit of the wider sporting sector. A lot of sports do not want the listed events regime to be opened up. I know that the Scottish National party likes the idea of a Government listed events fund, but SNP Members do not acknowledge the distortive effect it would have on the value of rights, nor do they say who would pay for it. I suspect that the UK taxpayer would and, once again, SNP promises would be paid for by everybody else."

I hope that we get close to what was promised to those who gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry and to a resolution that means greater fairness for everybody. Unfortunately, it feels as though the Bill is not the place where that will happen. It is clear from views across the House that change needs to happen to ensure that people get the redress and justice that they hope for."

Regulating with tools that are 20 years out of date is impossible. That is why it is important that the Bill is future proofed. The thought occurs to me that if it takes 20 more years before the House comes back to the subject, by then we will doubtless get sound and vision beamed straight into our ears and eyeballs after pressing the chip that will have been implanted in us. Regulating that will be even more difficult. I was pondering which Minister will be here in 20 years to cope with that, and it will almost certainly be my right hon. Friend "

The answer to that question can be traced back to one consistent factor: the role of the fossil fuel industry in our politics. For over those very same decades when climate scientists have been warning of the rapidly shrinking window to avert a climate emergency, fossil fuel companies and their lobbyists have been denying the science, and then they have delayed, weakened and sabotaged climate action.

I want to start with a case study, featuring the little-known fossil fuel lobby group Offshore Energies UK\u2014OEUK\u2014whose members include North sea operators such as Equinor, Harbour Energy, BP and Shell, and whose activities have resulted in a windfall tax that actually rewards companies for digging up more oil and gas, and a \u201cprice floor\u201d introduced entirely at the industry\u2019s behest. Let me explain how that has happened. According to analysis of data in the public domain, OEUK and its members met UK Government Ministers more than 210 times in the year following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014that is nearly once every working day. In June 2022, in that one month, when the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Bill was drafted and consulted on, the industry went into lobbying overdrive: OEUK and its operator members had twice as many meetings with Ministers as they did in the month before or after. It also held a parliamentary reception, in the name of the all-party group on the British offshore oil and gas industry, for which it provides, conveniently, the secretariat. The main message for the MPs and peers in attendance was that the windfall tax would \u201cundermine and disrupt\u201d  investment in the sector. In a meeting a few days later with the then Chancellor, now Prime Minister, the industry spelt out what it wanted to see in the Bill. Its recommendations, also put in writing to the Treasury, included protection for petroleum revenue tax repayments, which are, in essence, an existing tax break that can pay fossil fuel firms back for taxes they have paid in the past. The subsequent legislation did exactly as OEUK requested. Moreover, it introduced an enormous 80% \u201cinvestment allowance\u201d, which, combined with existing tax breaks, means that fossil fuel companies can claim \u00a391 back for every \u00a3100 they invest in UK oil and gas extraction. As a result of that climate-wrecking loophole, Shell, for example, went on to pay no windfall tax at all in 2022."

The Government outlined wide-ranging improvements to transparency around lobbying in their \u201cStrengthening Ethics and Integrity in Central Government\u201d policy statement of July 2023. These include revising guidance to widen the range of lobbying engagements declared by Departments, and linked reforms to the consultant lobbying framework. These measures, when implemented, will ensure that all lobbying activity, irrespective of  which sector is being represented, will be conducted openly and in accordance with the principles expected of participants in public life."

Such debate should be supported by an independent free press, and then, at the ballot box, we should trust the people."
