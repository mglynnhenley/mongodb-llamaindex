It is not the work of teachers, the taskforce clarifies, to investigate a pupil\u2019s absence. Teachers may do it\u2014it is vital work that needs doing\u2014but it also depends on our amazing support staff."

It includes a childcare system modernised from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school, high-quality early education, a focus on life chances for children\u2014not just on work choices for parents\u2014and high and rising standards right from the start, with early language interventions to identify and remove barriers to learning, and a determination to reform the SEND system, to put money behind children, not lawyers, and to tackle issues before they hold children back, with a new focus on primary numeracy so that children love maths at six, never mind at 16\u2014excellence for everyone; not for some of our children but for all of them. There will be free breakfast clubs in every primary school, because it is about the club, not just the breakfast. Every day, every child, every life and every start."

We will end the high-stakes, low-information culture, with annual checks for attendance, safeguarding and off-rolling. There will be mental health councillors in our secondary schools and new community hubs outside them, joining up the information that we have on our children so that every child can be supported between schools and services\u2014every issue caught, shared and addressed. And the cause for which we asked for time today? A law to register and count the children who are out of school."

                "text": "Labour is clear on how we will fund that package and the change that we need: by ending the tax breaks for private schools and the mega-rich. We will invest in what we most believe in: our children and their futures, excellence for everyone, high and rising standards, and a Britain where background is no barrier to opportunity. The legislation that we will introduce next month, with the House\u2019s permission if today\u2019s motion is agreed to, will be simple: it will be part 3 of the Government\u2019s own Schools Bill from 2022, which provided for a register of children not in school. That is nothing that Conservative Members would not have been prepared to vote for had it been tabled by their own Ministers, so there can be no reason or excuse for Conservative Members who care  about this issue not to support the motion today and the Bill next month. They can choose their party or our children. I commend the motion to the House."
